CONCEPT <Morphing>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTENTION
In this concept I want to describe the concept for the feature 'Morphing' in the
application 'Yin-Yang'.

Primaly the feature 'Morphing' describes the change from the application 
appearance between the normal 'Application' and the 'Configuration' mode.

Application mode
In the 'Application' mode the application have following appearance:
 - No applicaton border.
 - No 'scene' background.

'Configuration' mode
In the 'Configuration' mode the application have following appearance:
 - The application have a border.
 - The 'scene' background is visible.

Morphing
During the morphing between the mode 'Application' and 'Configuration'
 a) the application border will blend-in and -out.
 b) the 'scene' background will blend-in and -out.
 c) the posision from the application will be changed between:
     - In the 'Application' mode the user can define the position from the 
       applicaton individually.
     - In the 'Configuration' mode the position from the application will moved
       automatically to the center from the active sceen. Idea for the path from 
       the movement is a 'Bezier' curve where the first node have a value from 
       6/8 and the second node (on the other side) have 2/8 from the length 
       between the two different positions in the different modes.
